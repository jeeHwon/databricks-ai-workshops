---

## Prerequisites

You need a **Databricks workspace** with:

- Serverless SQL compute (or a running SQL warehouse)
- Foundation Model API access (Claude Sonnet 4, Llama 3.3 70B, or similar)
- Unity Catalog with permission to create schemas
- Vector Search enabled
- Databricks Apps enabled
- AI Gateway (Beta) — optional, Section 2 can be skipped if not enabled

**Permissions required:**

| Permission | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| `USE CATALOG` on your target catalog | Access existing catalog |
| `CREATE SCHEMA` on the catalog | Setup creates a new schema |
| `CREATE TABLE` on the new schema | Setup populates tables |
| Access to Foundation Model API | Agent and Playground need an LLM |
| Create Vector Search endpoints | Setup provisions a VS endpoint |

**No local tools required.** Everything runs in your browser through the Databricks workspace.

---

## Section 1: Codebase & Data Setup

**Time:** ~20 min (most of which is waiting for resources to provision)

This step creates the synthetic data, Vector Search index, Genie Space, and MLflow experiment that power the rest of the workshop.

### 1.1 Clone the Repository into Your Workspace

1. In your Databricks workspace, click **Workspace** in the left sidebar
2. Navigate to your user folder (`/Users/<your-email>/`)
3. Click the **...** menu > **Import**
4. Select **URL** and paste the repository URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/AnanyaDBJ/databricks-ai-workshops.git
   ```
5. Click **Import**

You should now see the full folder structure including `simple/`, `medium/`, `advanced/`, and `data/`.

### 1.2 Run the Data Setup Notebook

1. Navigate to `data/workspace_setup_script/01_quickstart_setup.py`
2. Attach the notebook to **Serverless** compute (or any existing cluster)
3. Fill in the widgets at the top:
   - **Catalog Name:** Your Unity Catalog (e.g., `ai_workshop_catalog`)
   - **Schema Name:** Leave as default `retail_grocery` or choose your own
4. Click **Run All**

> **Note:** The notebook takes 10-15 minutes to complete. Most of the time is spent provisioning the Vector Search endpoint.

> **Private Link / Firewall / Egress Restrictions:** If your workspace has network restrictions (Private Link, firewall rules, or blocked external egress), run the `data/workspace_setup_script/00-utils.ipynb` notebook **before** running the setup notebook. This utility notebook creates an MLflow experiment with artifact storage configured as a Databricks Volume (avoiding external storage dependencies) and handles downloads through internal paths. Refer to the [workshop conductor document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BwcOXfQ0XBRHrPnzThwRcd4289cMheshSE6EKbTcnTw/edit) for detailed instructions on restricted-network setups.

### 1.3 What Gets Created

When the notebook finishes, you'll have:

| Resource | Details |
|----------|---------|
| 6 structured tables | customers, products, stores, transactions, transaction_items, payment_history |
| 1 chunked docs table | policy_docs_chunked (~50 rows from 7 policy documents) |
| Vector Search endpoint | `freshmart-vs-<schema>` |
| Vector Search index | `<catalog>.<schema>.policy_docs_index` |
| Genie Space | `FreshMart Retail Data (<schema>)` |
| MLflow Experiment | `/Users/<you>/freshmart-agent-workshop` (with artifact storage as Databricks Volume) |
| UC Function | A utility function for the agent |

**Important:** Copy the output summary from the notebook. You'll need these values:
- **MLflow Experiment ID**
- **Vector Search Index name**
- **Genie Space ID**

### 1.4 Verify Resources

Before moving on, confirm:

- [ ] **Catalog Explorer:** Navigate to your catalog > schema — you should see 7 tables
- [ ] **Vector Search:** Under **Compute** > **Vector Search Endpoints**, your endpoint should be ONLINE (or still provisioning — give it a few more minutes)
- [ ] **Genie:** Click **Genie** in the left sidebar — you should see "FreshMart Retail Data"
- [ ] **Experiments:** Click **Experiments** in the left sidebar — you should see your experiment

---

## Section 2: AI Gateway (Beta)

**Time:** ~15 min

AI Gateway is the centralized governance and cataloging layer for all LLM interactions in your workspace. It sits between your applications and the model endpoints.

> **If AI Gateway Beta is not enabled in your workspace:** Skip this section entirely. The rest of the workshop works without it — your agent calls the Foundation Model API directly.

### 2.1 Navigate to AI Gateway

1. In the left sidebar, look for **AI Gateway** (under Machine Learning or as a top-level item)
2. Open the AI Gateway panel

### 2.2 Explore Key Capabilities

Walk through each feature:

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fallback Routing** | If the primary model is unavailable, automatically routes to a backup (e.g., Claude → Llama) |
| **Traffic Splitting** | A/B test models by routing a percentage of traffic to different endpoints |
| **Rate Limiting** | Prevent any single user or team from consuming all available capacity |
| **Payload Logging** | Record every prompt and response for compliance and debugging |
| **Guardrails** | Detect PII, block harmful content, enforce safety policies BEFORE responses reach users |
| **Metrics** | Real-time latency, throughput, and error rate monitoring |
| **Usage Dashboard** | Cost and token consumption broken down by user, team, or application |

### 2.3 Key Takeaway

Every LLM call in the workspace can be governed through this single control plane. When you deploy the agent in Section 4, its model calls route through AI Gateway automatically — giving you guardrails, logging, and cost tracking without any code changes.

---

## Section 3: Explore Platform Capabilities

**Time:** ~40 min

Now you'll explore the individual AI capabilities before combining them into an agent.

### 3.1 Play with Genie

Genie converts natural language questions into SQL queries and returns results from your data.

1. Click **Genie** in the left sidebar
2. Open **FreshMart Retail Data** (the space created in Section 1)
3. Try these questions:

| Question | What It Does |
|----------|-------------|
| "How many customers do we have?" | Simple count query |
| "What are the top 10 products by price?" | Sort and limit |
| "Show me revenue by store for the last 6 months" | Multi-table join with aggregation |
| "Which membership tier spends the most on average?" | Group by with calculation |
| "What payment methods are most popular?" | Aggregation on payment_history |
| "List all organic products in the Produce category" | Filter with text matching |

**What to observe:**
- Genie shows the **SQL it generated** — click to inspect
- Results appear as tables or charts
- You can ask follow-up questions to refine ("Now show that as a monthly trend")
- Genie uses your Unity Catalog table schemas to understand the data model

### 3.2 Explore Vector Search

Vector Search finds relevant documents by meaning, not just keywords.

1. Open **Catalog** in the left sidebar
2. Navigate to your catalog > schema > `policy_docs_index`
3. Click **Query** on the index page
4. Try these searches:

| Query | Expected Source Document |
|-------|------------------------|
| "Can I return perishable items?" | return_refund_policy |
| "How do I earn loyalty points?" | membership_loyalty_program |
| "What are your delivery hours?" | delivery_pickup_procedures |
| "Do you accept EBT payments?" | store_operating_procedures |
| "How do you handle product recalls?" | product_safety_recalls |
| "What data do you collect about me?" | privacy_policy |

**What to observe:**
- Results include a **similarity score** (closer to 1.0 = better match)
- The search finds answers even with different wording (semantic search)
- Each result shows the text chunk and source document name

### 3.3 Prototype an Agent in Playground

This is where everything comes together.

1. Open **Playground** in the left sidebar (under Machine Learning)
2. Select a Foundation Model (e.g., **Claude Sonnet 4** or **Llama 3.3 70B**)
3. Click **Add Tool** and add:
   - Your **Genie Space** (`FreshMart Retail Data`)
   - Your **Vector Search Index** (`policy_docs_index`)
   - Your **UC Function** (if created in setup)
4. Add a system prompt:

```
You are FreshMart Assistant, a friendly and knowledgeable retail agent for FreshMart grocery stores. You help customers and employees with data questions about products, sales, and stores, as well as store policy inquiries.

Guidelines:
- Be conversational and helpful
- Ground all answers in retrieved data — never fabricate information
- Cite your sources (which tool provided the data)
- For data questions, use Genie to query the database
- For policy questions, use Vector Search to find relevant documents
- Be concise but thorough
```

5. Test these conversations:

**Data question (uses Genie):**
> "What are the top 5 products by revenue?"

**Policy question (uses Vector Search):**
> "What is the return policy for perishable items?"

**Multi-tool question (uses both):**
> "I bought frozen fish yesterday and it was bad. Can I return it? How much revenue are we losing to returns?"

**What to observe:**
- The agent **automatically decides** which tool to use based on the question
- You can see the tool calls in the response
- The agent combines information from multiple tools naturally

### 3.4 Export to Databricks Apps

Once your agent is working in Playground:

1. Click the **"Get Code"** button (or "Export to App")
2. Select **OpenAI Agents SDK** as the template
3. Specify the MLflow experiment you created in Section 1
4. The generated code will be saved to your workspace

This exports a production-ready agent app with:
- The same model and tools configuration
- MLflow tracing built in
- A FastAPI server with chat UI
- Deployment configuration (`databricks.yml`)

> **Note:** You may see permission dialogs during export — the app needs a service principal to access your resources. See Troubleshooting if you encounter errors.

---

## Section 4: Databricks Apps — Custom Agent

**Time:** ~30 min

Now you have a full agent application. Let's deploy and test it.

### 4.1 Understand the App Architecture

The exported app (also available as `simple/L100-agent-openai-sdk/`) has this structure:

```
L100-agent-openai-sdk/
├── agent_server/
│   ├── agent.py          ← Agent logic: model, system prompt, MCP tools
│   ├── start_server.py   ← FastAPI server with MLflow tracing
│   ├── evaluate_agent.py ← Evaluation script
│   └── utils.py          ← Helpers
├── scripts/
│   ├── quickstart.py     ← One-command setup
│   └── start_app.py      ← Starts server + chat UI
├── databricks.yml        ← Deployment configuration
├── app.yaml              ← App settings
└── pyproject.toml        ← Python dependencies
```

The flow is:

```
Chat UI (browser) → FastAPI Server → OpenAI Agents SDK → MCP Tools
                                                          ├── Genie (data queries)
                                                          └── Vector Search (policy lookup)
                         ↓
                    MLflow Traces → Experiment
```

For detailed architecture, see [`L100-agent-openai-sdk/README.md`](./L100-agent-openai-sdk/README.md).

### 4.2 Deploy the App

**Option A: From the exported code (Section 3.4)**

If you used "Get Code" from Playground, the app is ready to deploy. Navigate to the app in Databricks Apps and wait for it to start.

**Option B: Deploy the pre-built template**

If you want to use the existing template in this repo:

1. Open a **Web Terminal** in your workspace (or use the Databricks CLI locally)
2. Navigate to the L100 agent folder:
   ```bash
   cd /Workspace/Users/<your-email>/databricks-ai-workshops/simple/L100-agent-openai-sdk
   ```
3. Deploy:
   ```bash
   databricks bundle deploy
   databricks bundle run agent_openai_agents_sdk
   ```

> **Note:** First deployment takes 3-5 minutes. Subsequent deployments are faster.

### 4.3 Test the Agent

1. Once the app is running, open its URL (shown in Databricks Apps UI or in the deploy output)
2. The chat UI opens in your browser
3. Test with these questions:

| Question | Expected Tool |
|----------|--------------|
| "What are the top 5 products by revenue?" | Genie |
| "What is the return policy for perishable items?" | Vector Search |
| "Which stores have the highest ratings?" | Genie |
| "How do I cancel my loyalty membership?" | Vector Search |
| "Compare our top-selling categories and check if we have return policies for each" | Both |

4. Ask **5-10 questions** to generate enough traces for evaluation

### 4.4 Verify Traces Are Captured

1. Go to **Experiments** in the left sidebar
2. Open your experiment (`freshmart-agent-workshop`)
3. You should see new traces — one per conversation turn
4. Click on a trace to see the full execution graph

> **Troubleshooting:** If traces don't appear, verify the `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID` in the app's configuration matches your experiment.

---

## Section 5: MLflow Evals & Governance

**Time:** ~40 min

Now that you have traces, let's evaluate agent quality systematically.

### 5.1 Observability — Explore Traces

1. Open **Experiments** > your experiment
2. Click on any trace
3. Study the execution graph:

| Step | What to Look For |
|------|-----------------|
| **Input** | The user's question |
| **LLM Reasoning** | How the model decided which tool to call |
| **Tool Selection** | Which MCP tool was chosen and why |
| **Tool Call** | The actual request sent to Genie/Vector Search |
| **Tool Response** | The data returned from the tool |
| **Final Output** | The composed answer sent back to the user |

4. Check the **Latency** panel — note how long each step takes
5. Check **Token Usage** — this determines cost per interaction

**Key insight:** Observability gives you full traceability for debugging, compliance, security, and auditability.

### 5.2 Run the Evaluation Notebook

1. Navigate to `simple/01_simple_agent_evaluation.ipynb`
2. Attach to Serverless compute
3. Update the experiment name widget to match your experiment
4. Run the evaluation cells

The notebook uses these MLflow scorers:

| Scorer | What It Measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| Completeness | Did the agent fully answer the question? |
| RelevanceToQuery | Is the response relevant to what was asked? |
| Safety | Does the response avoid harmful content? |
| ToolCallEfficiency | Did the agent use tools efficiently (no unnecessary calls)? |
| Correctness | Is the factual content accurate? |

5. Review the results table — you'll see scores for each trace

### 5.3 Identify a Failure and Iterate

1. Look for a trace with a **low score** on any metric
2. Open that trace and understand WHY it scored poorly:
   - Did it call the wrong tool?
   - Was the response incomplete?
   - Did it hallucinate information?
3. Fix the issue by updating the system prompt in `agent_server/agent.py`

**Example fix:** If the agent fails to cite sources, add to the system prompt:
```
Always cite which tool provided the information. For data queries, mention that the answer came from the Genie Space. For policy questions, mention the source document name.
```

4. Redeploy the agent:
   ```bash
   databricks bundle deploy
   databricks bundle run agent_openai_agents_sdk
   ```
5. Ask the same question again and verify the improvement
6. Re-run evaluation to confirm the metric improved

**Key insight:** The cycle is: deploy → trace → evaluate → find failures → fix prompt/tools → redeploy → re-evaluate.

### 5.4 Understanding MLflow's Evaluation Platform

- **70+ built-in LLM judges** — no need to build custom evaluators
- **Managed and OSS:** Same API works with Databricks-hosted and open-source MLflow
- **Continuous monitoring:** Run evaluations on a schedule to catch regressions
- **Compare versions:** Evaluate different prompts/models side by side

---

## Section 6: Human in the Loop

**Time:** ~25 min

Automated judges are powerful, but human feedback is ground truth. This section shows how domain experts can review and rate agent responses.

### 6.1 Add Traces to a Labelling Session

1. Go to **Experiments** > your experiment
2. Select 5-10 traces (checkboxes on the left)
3. Click **Add to Labelling Session** (or "Create Review Task")
4. Name the session (e.g., "Workshop Review")

### 6.2 Configure the Labelling Schema

Define what reviewers should evaluate:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Correctness | Rating (1-5) | Is the answer factually correct? |
| Helpfulness | Rating (1-5) | Would a real user find this useful? |
| Tool Usage | Yes/No | Did the agent use the right tool? |
| Notes | Free text | Any additional feedback |

### 6.3 Review Agent Responses

1. Navigate to the **Review App** (link shown after creating the session)
2. For each trace:
   - Read the user question and agent response
   - Rate correctness and helpfulness
   - Note if the agent used the wrong tool or missed information
   - Submit your review
3. Complete 3-5 reviews

### 6.4 Observe Feedback Integration

1. Go back to **Experiments** > your experiment
2. Open a trace you just reviewed
3. The human feedback is now attached to the trace metadata
4. This feedback can be used to:
   - Create evaluation datasets
   - Fine-tune the system prompt
   - Run automatic prompt optimization
   - Track quality trends over time

**Key insight:** Human review closes the loop: deploy → observe → human review → improve → redeploy.

---

## Section 7: Managed Agents

**Time:** ~25 min

Databricks offers no-code agent options that complement the custom agent you built in Section 4. These are ideal for simpler use cases or rapid prototyping.

### 7.1 Knowledge Assistant

A Knowledge Assistant is a RAG agent that answers questions from your documents — no code required.

1. Navigate to **Machine Learning** > **Agents** (or **Agent Builder**)
2. Click **Create** > **Knowledge Assistant**
3. Configure:
   - **Name:** "FreshMart Policy Assistant"
   - **Knowledge Source:** Select your Vector Search index (`policy_docs_index`)
   - Optionally: point to the raw documents volume for richer rendering
4. Click **Create**
5. Test it:

| Question | Expected Behavior |
|----------|------------------|
| "What's the loyalty program about?" | Retrieves membership_loyalty_program doc |
| "How long do I have to return an item?" | Retrieves return_refund_policy doc |
| "What are your privacy practices?" | Retrieves privacy_policy doc |

**What to notice:** This achieves the same thing as your Vector Search tool in the custom agent — but with zero code and a managed hosting model.

### 7.2 Supervisor Agent (Multi-Agent System)

A Supervisor Agent orchestrates multiple tools/agents, routing questions to the right one automatically.

1. Create a **Supervisor Agent**
2. Add these tools:
   - **Genie MCP** — your FreshMart Retail Data space
   - **Vector Search MCP** — your policy_docs_index
   - **UC Function MCP** — if available
3. Add a description and instructions
4. Test with multi-tool questions:

| Question | Expected Routing |
|----------|-----------------|
| "What were last month's sales?" | → Genie |
| "What's the return policy?" | → Vector Search |
| "Top products and their return policies" | → Both |

### 7.3 Comparing Approaches

| Aspect | Custom Agent (Section 4) | Managed Agents (Section 7) |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Code required** | Yes (Python, YAML) | No |
| **Customization** | Full control | Limited to configuration |
| **UI** | Custom chat app | Built-in interface |
| **Deployment** | Databricks Apps | Managed hosting |
| **Use case** | Production apps, complex logic | Quick prototypes, simple Q&A |
| **Tracing** | Full MLflow integration | Built-in observability |

Both are production-ready. Choose based on your needs: simple use cases get managed agents, complex workflows get custom apps.

---

## Section 8: Document Intelligence (Optional)

**Time:** ~15 min

> **Coming Soon** — This section is under development. Document Intelligence enables intelligent parsing of complex PDFs (tables, forms, scanned images) beyond simple text chunking. Check back for detailed instructions.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Section | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| "Please enter a catalog name" error | 1 | Fill in the Catalog Name widget before running |
| Setup notebook can't find policy docs | 1 | Import the FULL repository, not just the `simple/` folder |
| Vector Search endpoint stuck provisioning | 1 | Wait up to 15 minutes. Check **Compute** > **Vector Search Endpoints** |
| "No SQL warehouse found" | 1 | Create a serverless SQL warehouse or start an existing one |
| AI Gateway not visible in sidebar | 2 | Beta not enabled in your workspace — skip Section 2 |
| Genie not answering questions | 3 | Verify the SQL warehouse linked to the Genie Space is running |
| Vector Search returns no results | 3 | Index sync may still be in progress — wait a few minutes |
| Playground doesn't show tools | 3 | Re-add tools; confirm VS index is ONLINE |
| "Get Code" export fails | 3 | Check you have workspace write permissions; see permission dialog |
| App crashes on startup | 4 | Check logs: `databricks apps logs <app-name>`. Likely service principal permissions |
| App returns errors | 4 | Verify resource permissions in `databricks.yml` match actual resources |
| No traces in experiment | 5 | Verify `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID` in app config matches your experiment |
| Evaluation notebook errors | 5 | Ensure experiment has traces with status `OK` (not failed traces) |
| Labelling session is empty | 6 | Select traces first, THEN create the session |
| Knowledge Assistant returns nothing | 7 | VS index must be ONLINE and synced |
| Permission denied on catalog | All | Ask workspace admin for `CREATE SCHEMA` and `USE CATALOG` permissions |
